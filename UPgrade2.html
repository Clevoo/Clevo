                <p><strong> Front-end web development,</strong></p>
            </span>also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS
            and
            JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
            challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the
            front end of
            a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
            developing.
            <br>
            A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies (i.e.,
            HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run on the Open Web Platform or act as compilation input for
            non-web platform environments (i.e., React Native).

                <p><strong>The Back-end document</strong></p>
            </span>refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and
            that
            cannot be accessed by a user. Most data and operating syntax are stored and accessed in the back end of
            a
            computer system. Typically the code is comprised of one or more programming languages. The back end is
            also
            called the data access layer of software or hardware and includes any functionality that needs to be
            accessed
            and navigated to by digital means.

                    <p><strong>HTML,in full HyperText Markup Language,</strong></p>
                </span>a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the
                Internet. Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page (from World Wide Web), and such pages frequently
                contain hypertext links that allow related pages to be retrieved. HTML is the markup language for
                encoding Web pages. It was designed by the British scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee at the CERN nuclear
                physics laboratory in Switzerland during the 1980s.

                <span>
                    <p><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) ,</strong></p>
                </span>is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
                written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
                should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

                CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
                specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done
                synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about
                CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without
                a version number.

                <span>
                    <p><strong>JavaScript (often shortened to JS)</strong></p>
                </span> is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with
                first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many
                non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is
                dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

                JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages
                behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting
                language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.

                    Digital marketing, also called online marketing, is the promotion of brands to connect with
                    potential
                    customers using the internet and other forms of digital communication. This includes not only email,
                    social media, and web-based advertising, but also text and multimedia messages as a marketing
                    channel.

                    Essentially, if a marketing campaign involves digital communication, it's digital marketing.
